Unix is  free operating system  -->ubuntu,linux
most of the servers are written in Unix
windows             				unix 
1CLI(command-line interface)    		Graphical User Interface
2.high compatabilty				less compatabilty
3.not open source				open source
4.vulnerable to hackers				not vulnerable to hackers
5.Proprietary commercial software license	GPL (GNU General Public License) license
6.cost						no cost
7.Micro-kernel					Monolithic kernel
8.no						OS with military-grade encryption?

Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie began developing Unix in 1969 at AT&T's Bell Labs research center.

web server vs application server
web server
1A web server primarily delivers static content like HTML pages and images, focusing on fast delivery
 2web server serves static files
3.Servers:Apache HTTP Server, Nginx, Microsoft IIS
4.fast

application server
1.handles dynamic content by executing business logic and interacting with databases, generating customized responses based on user input; 
2.application server runs the logic behind a web application. 
3.Apache Tomcat, JBoss, IBM WebSphere, Oracle WebLogic 
4.slow

Note:
1.a web server acts as the first point of contact, receiving HTTP requests and forwarding dynamic content requests to an application server which then generates the response.
2.connect one machine to another in a same network:
	windows to windows---->Remote De3sktop Connection(same network)
	windows to linux----->use putty(another network)

download and install Cygwin for windows	
terminal--->
commands
1.pwd-->present working directory
2.ls-->gives list of files and folders
ls -lt-->long list sorted from new to old  ls -ltr  -->long list sorted from  old to new ( long list with read/write permissions of the user)
drwxr-xr-x --->"d" represents directory
-rwxr-xr-x ---->represents file
3.mkdir -->create a new folder or directory
4.clear -->clear the command prompt 
5.touch -->create an empty file or to update the timestamp of existing file
	->touch filename.txt  (create a new file if not exist earlier)
				(create a new timestamp if  file already exists)
	-->touch filename1.txt filename1.txt filename2.txt (creates multiple files)
	-->touch -t 202501171200.00 filename.txt (create a specific timestamp)
	-->touch -c filename2.txt(updates timestamp if filename2.txt already exists)
	-rw-r--r-- 1 prakr prakr              0 Jan 17 00:46 float.txt
	  -rw-r--r--  ==>no d so it is not a directory but file , read write permissions of a user
			(rw-owner of the file(o)
			 r-owner of the group(g)
			 r-others(o))
	  1	      ==> number of links
	prakr	      ==>owner name
	prakr		==>owner group
	0             ==>file size
	Jan 17 00:46  ==>date and time at which the file created
	float.txt   ==>file name

values for operations
read- 4
write - 2
execute -1
-rw-r--r-- 
644 is the numeric mode of  permission of this file

chmod is to change the file permissions of the file
eg --> chmod 664 float txt  ---> will give read write permissions to the group
6.vi -->open a file,view the contents,write in to the file and save the contents of the file
   vi  numbers.txt
   press insert - write contents - esc :wq to save
   vi  numbers.txt
	show the contents  of the file inside the file
7.cat numbers.txt
  show the contents  of the file in the terminal itself
8.

why testers need unix?
web server and application serber are installed in unix machines
log files are written in unix
log files contains all the actions , transactions and operations done in your project alomg with timestamp
what done in console may go in the same day ,log files may contain all information that happened 20 to 30 days before
log files will be configured by the developer
testers can send the log files with errors and issues got in our project  to the developer to fix the issue
for viewing the log files we can access the server using putty
